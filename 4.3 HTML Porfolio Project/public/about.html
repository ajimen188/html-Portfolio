<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio page my name is Abraham Jimenez I am currently trying to become a web developer and build 
  my skills within the programming parameters. I have always worked in hard labor intensive jobs that require no skill.
  The reason I took coding as a alternative was because my brother inspired me into thinking that this can become a long
  range career with unlimited potential as long as you're willing to put in the time and dedication to move forward and 
  succeed. My training up to this point as been phenomenal and I have been able to learn amazing aspect about how the 
  system within the internet works. Its amazing to think that so much is required in order to have such a functional website 
  or application in the Internet. As someone who was raised around advanced technology I now realize how much effort it takes 
  to create something. I would like to thank you for reading my portfolio and allowing me to show you what I’m capable now.
  I  appreciate all of you much love.

  california.
